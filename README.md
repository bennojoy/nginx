    # A hash of the http paramters. Note that any
    # valid nginx http paramters can be added here.
    # (see the nginx documentation for details.)
    nginx_http_params:                                    
      sendfile: "on"                                      
      tcp_nopush: "on"
      tcp_nodelay: "on"
      keepalive_timeout: "65"
      access_log: "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
      error_log: "/var/log/nginx/error.log"

    # A list of hashs that define the servers for nginx,
    # as with http parameters. Any valid server parameters
    # can be defined here.
    nginx_sites:                                         
     - server:                                           
        file_name: foo
        listen: 8080
        server_name: localhost
        root: "/tmp/site1"
        location1: {name: /, try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}
        location2: {name: /images/, try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}
     - server:
        file_name: bar
        listen: 9090
        server_name: ansible
        root: "/tmp/site2"
        location1: {name: /, try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}
        location2: {name: /images/, try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}

Examples
========

1) Install nginx with HTTP directives of choices, but with no sites
configured:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
      - {role: nginx,
         nginx_http_params: { sendfile: "on",
                              access_log: "/var/log/nginx/access.log"},
                              nginx_sites: none }


2) Install nginx with different HTTP directives than previous example, but no
sites configured.

    - hosts: all
      roles:
      - {role: nginx,
         nginx_http_params: { tcp_nodelay: "on",
                              error_log: "/var/log/nginx/error.log"}, 
                              nginx_sites: none }

Note: Please make sure the HTTP directives passed are valid, as this role
won't check for the validity of the directives. See the nginx documentation
for details.

3) Install nginx and add a site to the configuration.

    - hosts: all

      roles:
      - role: nginx,
        nginx_http_params:
          sendfile: "on"
          access_log: "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
          nginx_sites:
          - server:
             file_name: bar
             listen: 8080
             location1: {name: "/", try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}
             location2: {name: /images/, try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.html"}

Note: Each site added is represented by list of hashes, and the configurations
generated are populated in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and have corresponding
symlinks from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

The file name for the specific site configurtaion is specified in the hash
with the key "file_name", any valid server directives can be added to hash.
For location directive add the key "location" suffixed by a unique number, the
value for the location is hash, please make sure they are valid location
directives.

4) Install Nginx and add 2 sites (different method)
